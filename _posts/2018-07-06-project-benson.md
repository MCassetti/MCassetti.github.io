title: Targetting Demographics with Open Source Data
---
### Introduction
In this exploratory data analysis, a company called Women Tech Women Yes is looking to distribute 
leafleters in order to boost attendance and donations at their 2018 Gala. For the exploration, 
our team proposes optimal locations by using target demographic and open source data.

The target demographic in this example, can range from spefic to broad. 
For the scope of exploration project, we chose to remaing broad, focusing instead on the following

1. Time of day with highest foot traffic
2. Subway locations with high density of upscale restaraunts
3. Locations located in low crime areas  
 
Additionally, we need the total number of people to be high enough
to account for low engagement rates with leafleters.  

### Data Sources
Three sources were leveraged to do this analysis were as follows
1. MTA Turnstile Data 
2. Yelp API
3. NY Crime Statistics 

### Tools
1) Python's pickle module
2) Pandas
3) Yelp Api
4) NYC Open Data 
5) GeoPandas

### Data Model


### Data Processing
The MTA turnstile data along with Pandas was used to clean and repackage the 
data. Pandas is a power python tool for packacking and analzying data sets. GeoPandas is another

The Turnstile data is riddled with erroenous entries including negative values. Here is an example
of some code that can be used to filter out these data points
```python

```
